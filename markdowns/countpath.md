Imagine bugbug is in an $M$ by $N$ grid. He starts at the bottom left corner, $(0,
0)$, and wants to end up at the top right corner $(M-1, N-1)â€‹$.

Bugbug is only capable of moving **right** or **up**. Write a function `count_paths` that takes a grid length and
width and returns the number of different paths bugbug can take from the start to the goal. (There is a closed-form solution to this problem, but try to answer it procedurally using recursion.)
