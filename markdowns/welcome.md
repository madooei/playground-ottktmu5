## Welcome aboard!

In this recitation, we will:

1. Briefly review the basics of recursive programming.
2. Solve a _warm-up_ exercise similar to those we've seen in lecture.
3. Solve a problem that requires multiple recursive calls in its solution.

There are a few exercises at the end which we will leave as homework to you (you are welcome to work on these during the recitation, if you finish everything else with time to spare).

### Learning goals:

* Review basics of recursion.
* Be able to decompose a recursive problem into recursive steps and base cases.
* Learn about _counting problems_ as an example of problems that would require multiple recursive calls.



Feel free to work on the exercises individually or in a small group (two or three students).
